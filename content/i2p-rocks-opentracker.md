Title: public open tracker now open for business

I have set up an open public bittorrent tracker.

The announce url is udp://i2p.rocks:6969

### Can I remove an info_hash from the tracker?

No, the technology doesn't include any support for blocking info_hash keys from being registered with the tracker.

Just to make it clear so people that may send DMCA takedown notices understand:

* I do not have any content.
* I am not a bittorrent site, I am just a tracker, I can not see what content is behind an info_hash.
* I don't have any torrent files.
* I can't give you any IP addresses in any other way than normal tracker usage.
* I can't verify any claims when I have no data other than the info_hash.
* I can't block info_hash keys from being registered with the tracker.
* I don't have any logs or ways to trace previous connections, It's not technically possible to trace connection history due to the sheer volume of connections. The only information that is possible to keep is the current torrent swarm.

If you are a content owner, Contact the indexing site where the torrent download originated from and ask them nicely to remove the listing and the .torrent file.
