Title: i2p.rocks in proxy down for rewrite

i2p.rocks inproxy will be done again until I get a chance to rewrite the in proxy app server in full, the nginx configuration I was using stopped working as of nginx 1.10.

The source code is on github [here](https://github.com/majestrate/inproxy), feel free to help out.

This project is not a very high priority and i2p.rocks will be back up once this rewrite is done.
