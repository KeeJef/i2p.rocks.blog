Good news for Ubuntu/Linux Mint users of [Invisible Internet](http://i2pd.website)! You can now install [i2pd](http://i2pd.website) very easily from PPA repository created by community member [R4SAS](https://twitter.com/i2pr4sas).

Add the PPA and install i2pd using the following commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:purplei2p/i2pd
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install i2pd

That's it. When new version of i2pd will be available, you'll recieve updates via package manager.
