Title: mempo mirror


i2p.rocks now has a mirror for the mempo linux distrobution [here](/mempo/).
It was downloaded off of freenet so some files may have not transferred correctly.
Be sure to donate to mempo, it's a pretty cool project.

(Donate to [me](/static/btc.png) to keep this mirror up and running)
