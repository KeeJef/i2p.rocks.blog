Title: XD 0.1.0-pre3 released, release sooooooon â„¢
Authors: jeff

XD 0.1.0-pre3 is out on [github](https://github.com/majestrate/XD/releases/tag/v0.1.0-pre3)

Once all the bugs are flattened I will be releasing 0.1.0, this should be by April (probably).

You'll notice the memory use is much MUCH lower, this is because XD no longer caches pieces in memory while downloading (I don't know why I thought that was a good route in the first place...)
