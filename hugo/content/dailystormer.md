Title: I2Pd and friends do not care if the left thinks you're a bigot.
Authors: Jeff

Recently Tor Project published a [blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-project-defends-human-rights-racists-oppose) condemning The Daily Stormer (a very prominent white nationalist forum that has been marginalized off the internet) setting up a hidden service. This is very concerning to all, the light of anonymous free speech seems to have dimmed as a result. It's only free speech until someone calls it hateful... is that what the good people over at Tor Project think? Let's hope not.

<strike>I2P (at least i2pd and friends)</strike> I2PD (and friends) do not bow to wrongthink pressure from the moral high horse cavalry. Feel free to discuss whatever just try to not break any laws.
