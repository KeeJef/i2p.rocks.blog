Title: Fed up with SystemD

This morning I woke up with no network connection on my desktop. After checking the ports and doing ``systemctl restart networking`` a few times I finally got online. Don't get me wrong, I want a 'one golden standard' for the Linux userland, I just don't want SystemD. With SystemD it's the little things that make the experience painful, you know, fucky network connectivity, no keyboard access before you can unlock your disks when you use FDE, loosing both X and tty when X crashes. The supporters of SystemD say it's going to get better, I know they are right, but given the direction SystemD is going it's going to get a LOT worse before it gets any better (*cough systemd merging su cough*).

SystemD has been a regression in the Power User experience at least for me. GNU has lost its edge, perhaps it's too late for redemption. I'm done with Linux, hopefully FreeBSD is better.
