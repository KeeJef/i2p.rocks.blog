Title: i2p.rocks in proxy down for a bit


i2p.rocks in proxy will be down for a bit since I have moved my VPS to digital ocean. I will need another VPS in order to host the in proxy since the i2p.rocks in proxy probably violates the ToS of digital ocean. Until the service is restored use i2p.xyz. To expidite the process of getting another VPS to host the in proxy donate to my bitcoin address.
