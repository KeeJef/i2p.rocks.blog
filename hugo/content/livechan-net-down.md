Title: livechan.net is down?

Looks like [livechan](https://livechan.net/) is down so I have set up an instance of the beta software [here](http://i2p.rocks/livechan/).

If you are interested in helping this project along, [fork it on github](https://github.com/majestrate/livechan/) and submit pull requests
when you implement a feature, fix a bug, improve the css or create a new theme.
