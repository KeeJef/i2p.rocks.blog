Title: Trial By Fire

It seems people like the livechan beta. I asked Fred from 8ch.net to explode
the test server with users and he sure did not disappoint.

Thanks to the massive volume of posts that were received when the server was up I was able to find some race conditions in the code.

Features to come when the server comes back:

* Moderation
* Flood control
* A Captcha that actually works

In the immediate future:

* More Formatting
* Youtube embeds

Long Term future:

* User end Filtering
* Channel Registering
* More stuff I probably can't think of now
